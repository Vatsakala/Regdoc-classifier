===== FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS =====

You MUST output ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "category": "string",
  "unsafe": boolean,
  "kid_safe": boolean,
  "confidence": float between 0.0 and 1.0,
  "reasoning": "string",
  "citations": [{"page": int, "reason": "string"}]
}

CONFIDENCE SCORING REMINDER:
- DO NOT use the same confidence for every case
- Base confidence on: evidence clarity, amount of content, certainty of classification
- Strong clear evidence = higher confidence (0.85-0.98)
- Moderate evidence or some ambiguity = medium confidence (0.65-0.84)
- Unclear or limited evidence = lower confidence (0.40-0.64)

DO NOT:
- Wrap JSON in markdown (no ```json or ```)
- Add any explanatory text before the JSON
- Add any explanatory text after the JSON
- Use null or None (use false/true or empty string/array)
- Use the same confidence score repeatedly

START your response with { and END with }
Output ONLY the JSON object.
