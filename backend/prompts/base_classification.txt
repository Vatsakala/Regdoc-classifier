===== CLASSIFICATION RULES (APPLY IN ORDER) =====

Rule 1: If SSN detected → category = "Highly Sensitive"
Rule 2: If unsafe content → add "and Unsafe" to category
Rule 3: If ONLY business contact (sales@company.com) → can stay "Public"
Rule 4: If personal email/phone → minimum "Highly Sensitive"
Rule 5: If "Internal Use Only" label → minimum "Confidential"

===== CHILD SAFETY RULES =====

Set kid_safe = false if document contains:
- Strong profanity: f*ck, sh*t, b*tch, ass, damn
- Sexual content, nudity, or sexual references
- Graphic violence, gore, disturbing imagery
- Drug use instructions

Otherwise set kid_safe = true

===== CONFIDENCE SCORING =====

Your confidence score reflects how certain you are about the classification.

High confidence (0.85-1.0):
- Clear indicators present (SSN visible, explicit threats, obvious marketing)
- Multiple supporting pieces of evidence
- No ambiguity in content type

Medium confidence (0.6-0.84):
- Some indicators present but context is somewhat unclear
- Limited evidence available
- Document could reasonably fit multiple categories

Low confidence (0.3-0.59):
- Ambiguous content with unclear purpose
- Minimal text or information to analyze
- Conflicting indicators present

Base your confidence on the strength and clarity of evidence, not on preset numbers for categories.

===== CITATION REQUIREMENTS =====

For EVERY classification factor, provide a citation with:
- Exact page number where you found it
- Specific detail (not vague descriptions)

GOOD: {"page": 2, "reason": "SSN 123-45-6789 in employment form field"}
GOOD: {"page": 1, "reason": "Profanity 'f*ck' appears multiple times"}
BAD: {"page": 2, "reason": "sensitive information"}
BAD: {"page": 1, "reason": "bad words"}

  "kid_safe": true,
