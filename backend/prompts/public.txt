===== CONTEXT: LOW-RISK DOCUMENT =====

Initial analysis suggests this is likely a PUBLIC document.

CONFIRM AS PUBLIC if you see:
✓ Marketing language: "Buy now", "Limited offer", "Contact us for pricing"
✓ Product descriptions without technical specs or internal details
✓ Company logos, stock photos, generic images
✓ Only business contact: info@company.com, sales@company.com, 1-800 numbers
✓ Public website content, press releases

UPGRADE TO CONFIDENTIAL if you see:
✗ "Internal Use Only", "Draft", "Confidential" watermarks
✗ Internal project code names (Project Phoenix, Alpha release)
✗ Meeting notes or strategic planning language
✗ Employee-only information or training materials

UPGRADE TO HIGHLY SENSITIVE if you see:
✗ ANY Social Security Number (XXX-XX-XXXX)
✗ Personal email addresses (john.doe@gmail.com)
✗ Personal phone numbers without business context
✗ Credit card numbers, account numbers
✗ Home addresses (not business addresses)

IMPORTANT: Business contact info does NOT make a document sensitive.
- info@company.com = PUBLIC (business email)
- john.doe@gmail.com = HIGHLY SENSITIVE (personal email)

===== CONFIDENCE GUIDANCE FOR PUBLIC DOCUMENTS =====

Higher confidence when:
- Professional design with clear marketing intent
- Multiple pages of consistent public-facing content
- Clear business contact info with no ambiguous personal data
- Standard marketing or product language throughout

Lower confidence when:
- Limited content available to analyze
- Mixed signals (some internal language, some public)
- Unclear whether contact info is business or personal
- Document purpose is ambiguous

===== EXAMPLE CLASSIFICATIONS =====

Example 1 - Clear Product Catalog:
Input: 20-page catalog with products, pricing, "Contact: sales@acme.com", professional design
Decision: PUBLIC
Confidence: 0.91 (clear marketing material with extensive public content)
Reasoning: Comprehensive product catalog with consistent marketing content and only business contact information throughout

Example 2 - Simple Brochure:
Input: 2-page flyer with product info and company website
Decision: PUBLIC
Confidence: 0.78 (limited content but clearly public-facing)
Reasoning: Brief marketing flyer with public website, but limited content for thorough analysis

Example 3 - Ambiguous Newsletter:
Input: Newsletter with mix of product updates and mention of "internal team celebration"
Decision: CONFIDENTIAL (not Public)
Confidence: 0.68 (mixed signals between public and internal)
Reasoning: Newsletter contains both public product information and references to internal company events

===== DECISION GUIDE =====

Ask yourself:
1. Could this document be published on a public website without modification?
2. Does it contain ONLY business contact info (no personal data)?
3. Is there any "Internal", "Draft", or "Confidential" marking?
4. Are there personal phone numbers, emails, or addresses?

Adjust confidence based on:
- Clarity of evidence (clear vs ambiguous)
- Amount of content available (extensive vs minimal)
- Consistency of signals (uniform vs mixed)

Default to PUBLIC only if reasonably certain. When in doubt between Public and Confidential, choose Confidential with moderate confidence.
