===== CONTEXT: PII DETECTED =====

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was found in this document.

===== STEP 1: IDENTIFY PII TYPE =====

Check what was detected in pii_findings:

TYPE A - SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN):
Format: XXX-XX-XXXX or 9 consecutive digits
Examples: 123-45-6789, 987654321
ACTION: MUST classify as "Highly Sensitive"

TYPE B - CREDIT CARD NUMBER:
Format: 16 digits (may have spaces/dashes)
Examples: 1234-5678-9012-3456, 1234567890123456
ACTION: MUST classify as "Highly Sensitive"

TYPE C - PERSONAL CONTACT:
- Personal email: john.doe@gmail.com, jane@yahoo.com
- Personal phone: (555) 123-4567 without company name nearby
- Home address: 123 Main St, Apt 4B
ACTION: Classify as "Highly Sensitive"

TYPE D - BUSINESS CONTACT (NOT SENSITIVE):
- Business email: info@company.com, sales@acme.com, support@business.com
- Business phone: 1-800-555-0100, (555) 555-CORP
ACTION: Does NOT increase sensitivity
Can remain "Public" if no other sensitive data

===== STEP 2: APPLY DECISION TREE =====

If SSN found:
  → category = "Highly Sensitive"
  → Cite exact page with SSN
  → Confidence depends on clarity: clear SSN format = higher, ambiguous = lower

Else if credit card found:
  → category = "Highly Sensitive"
  → Cite exact page with credit card number
  → Confidence depends on: full number vs partial, context clarity

Else if personal email OR personal phone found:
  → category = "Highly Sensitive"
  → Cite pages with personal contact info
  → Confidence depends on: how many instances, how clearly personal vs business

Else if ONLY business contact found:
  → category = "Public" OR "Confidential" (based on other content)
  → Add to reasoning: "Only business contact detected (not personally sensitive)"
  → Confidence based on overall document content and purpose

===== CONFIDENCE FACTORS FOR SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS =====

Higher confidence:
- Clear, unambiguous SSN or credit card number
- Multiple instances of personal PII
- Context clearly shows personal (not business) information
- Form fields explicitly labeled (SSN:, Personal Email:, etc.)

Lower confidence:
- Partial numbers that might be SSN or might be something else
- Ambiguous whether contact is personal or business
- Limited context around the PII
- Numbers that could be dates, IDs, or other non-PII

===== STEP 3: CHECK FOR UNSAFE OVERRIDE =====

If PII document ALSO contains unsafe content:
  → category = "Highly Sensitive and Unsafe"
  → unsafe = true
  → kid_safe = false

===== EXAMPLES =====

Example 1 - Clear Employment Application:
Input: Completed form with clear fields "SSN: 123-45-6789", "DOB: 01/15/1985", labeled sections
Output:
{
  "category": "Highly Sensitive",
  "unsafe": false,
  "kid_safe": true,
  "confidence": 0.96,
  "reasoning": "Employment application with clearly labeled Social Security Number and date of birth in standard form format",
  "citations": [
    {"page": 2, "reason": "SSN 123-45-6789 in clearly labeled employment form field"},
    {"page": 2, "reason": "Date of birth in personal information section"}
  ]
}

Example 2 - Customer List with Mixed Quality:
Input: Spreadsheet with names and some email addresses, some appear personal (gmail) others unclear
Output:
{
  "category": "Highly Sensitive",
  "unsafe": false,
  "kid_safe": true,
  "confidence": 0.79,
  "reasoning": "Customer list contains what appear to be personal email addresses, though some entries are incomplete or unclear",
  "citations": [
    {"page": 1, "reason": "Multiple Gmail addresses suggesting personal email in customer records"},
    {"page": 1, "reason": "Phone numbers without clear business context"}
  ]
}

Example 3 - Marketing with Business Contact Only:
Input: Brochure with "Questions? Email info@acme.com or call 1-800-555-0100"
Output:
{
  "category": "Public",
  "unsafe": false,
  "kid_safe": true,
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "reasoning": "Marketing brochure contains only standard business contact information, no personal identifiable data detected",
  "citations": [
    {"page": 1, "reason": "Generic business email info@acme.com (not personally identifiable)"}
  ]
}

Example 4 - Partial or Ambiguous Data:
Input: Document with numbers that might be SSN (123-45-XXXX) and contact info with unclear context
Output:
{
  "category": "Highly Sensitive",
  "unsafe": false,
  "kid_safe": true,
  "confidence": 0.67,
  "reasoning": "Document contains partially redacted numbers in SSN format and contact information without clear business context, treating as sensitive out of caution",
  "citations": [
    {"page": 3, "reason": "Partially visible number matching SSN format"},
    {"page": 3, "reason": "Contact information without clear business association"}
  ]
}

===== CRITICAL REMINDERS =====

- SSN = ALWAYS "Highly Sensitive" but vary confidence based on clarity
- Personal email (gmail.com, yahoo.com) = "Highly Sensitive"
- Business email (info@company.com) = NOT sensitive
- Confidence should reflect: evidence clarity, amount of PII, certainty of interpretation
- When in doubt about business vs personal, err toward "Highly Sensitive" with moderate confidence
